#### Special cases
  1. If you update the quickbooks test data (see below), quickbooks entities created in testing (customers, transactions, etc) will be deleted. When loading transactions, you may see errors like "There was an error communicating with QuickBooks. An administrator has been notified. Some data may be out of date. (Error: Invalid Reference Id: Invalid Reference Id : Customer assigned to this transaction has been deleted. Before you can modify this transaction, you must restore zecb98905 (deleted).)." In order to restore the customer:
     1. Navigate to Customers in Quickbooks. 
     1. Select the gear icon in the upper right of the Customers data area (not the gear in the main nav bar at the very top). Select 
     1. Select "Include inactive"
     1. Search for the id (e.g. zecb98905).
     1. Click on the customer, whose display name is the id (e.g. zecb98905). 
     1. Click "Make Active" in the upper right. This will make the edit button appear. 
     1. Click "Edit"
     1. Update the display name to be the name of the co-op in Quickbooks. You may be alerted that the name is already being used and asked if the customers should be merged. In this case, select "no" and add "(Customer)" to the end of the name. If similar happens with real data, TWW staff will need to manually combine the two customers in QB.  
     1. Reload transactions in Quickbooks. The error should be gone.
